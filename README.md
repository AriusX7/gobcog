Hello! You found the adventure page!

This cog was originally made by locastan and can be found at the fork link above.


This version is significantly different internally and features:

* Using Config for data management and more atomic user attribute saving
* Expanded mob/monster list for a stat and monster combo of over 2,800 possibilities
* Added 300% more gear possibilities
* Doubled the amount of item slots
* The game can be played on multiple servers at once


Things I would like to improve in the future, or will very gladly welcome PRs on:

* Better handling of bundled data json loading (load files once in startup of cog, refer to it elsewhere with the variable)
* Theme packs with the ability to use commands to manage them for theming the game.
* Use the backpack formatter to format the stats page the same way (appropriate alignment/spacing of items like the backpack has)
* Use the backpack formatter to format forging pages the same way
* End of game HP display (show total groupsâ€™ hit vs mob points, for both str and cha)
* Make it so that the backpack can hold more than 1x of each item (double items overwrite)
* Trade unopened loot boxes between players
* Add alternate stats like dexterity/agility that would affect things like critical chance (and revamping the entire system to accept and use other stats like that)
* Add player races (gives permanent bonus that scales with level for 1-5 additional points in a stat)
* Revamp calculations for player 1-20 rolls during adventure to mitigate stat bloat at the higher end of the game (currently managed through a very wide range of mobs with varying str/hp values)

If you have something you would like to request for this cog, PLEASE OPEN AN ISSUE HERE AND DESCRIBE IT. I will not be taking requests for this via DMs or Discord messages. This cog is also on hold for improvements authored by me until I have more time for it, but nothing wrong with writing something yourself and PRing it!
